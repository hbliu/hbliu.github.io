I am a postdoctoral fellow in [Susztak Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/susztaklab) in the Departments of Genetics and Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.
Since 2007, my research has mainly focused on the genomics and epigenomics of complex human diseases by developing scalable machine-learning methods and integrating 
multimodal genomic and epigenomic data. A central objective of my study is to understand the genetic basis and epigenetic regulation of complex human diseases, 
by integrating genome-wide association studies with transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses. 
These studies have answered population genetic questions about epigenome-mediated heritability and causal gene prioritization via epigenome.

In the latest study, I performed a comprehensive mapping of genetic architecture of kidney disease by integrating genomic analysis of GWAS (N=1.5 million), kidney eQTL (N=686), meQTL (N=443), snATACseq (N=60K cells), coloc, moloc, SMR, pheWAS. I proposed a multi-stage prioritization strategy and prioritized >500 kidney disease genes.

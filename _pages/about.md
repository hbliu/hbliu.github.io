I am a Research Associate in [Susztak Lab](https://www.med.upenn.edu/susztaklab) in the Departments of Genetics and Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. 

Starting in March 2024, I'll be leading [my own lab](https://hbliulab.org/) at the University of Rochester as an Assistant Professor. The research in my lab will focus on decoding the functional genome's role in aging and age-related diseases.

* 08/16/2022: In the latest study, I performed a comprehensive mapping of genetic architecture of kidney disease by integrating genomic analysis of GWAS (N=1.5 million), kidney eQTL (N=686), meQTL (N=443), snATACseq (N=60K cells), coloc, moloc, SMR, pheWAS. I proposed a multi-stage prioritization strategy and prioritized >500 kidney disease genes.
